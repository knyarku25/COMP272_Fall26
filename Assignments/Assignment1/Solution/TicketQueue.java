 * TicketQueue: a small "who's next" line for a customer-service desk.

 * Customers are served in the order they arrive -- first in, first out
 * (FIFO). This class is backed by java.util.ArrayDeque, used through the
 * Queue interface: offer() adds at the back, poll() removes and returns
 * the front, peek() looks at the front without removing it.
 *
 * Notice what this class does NOT offer: there is no get(index), no way
 * to reach directly into the middle of the line. That is deliberate -- a
 * Queue ADT only promises FIFO access at the two ends, unlike the
 * SequenceList from Part 1, which promises indexed access everywhere.
